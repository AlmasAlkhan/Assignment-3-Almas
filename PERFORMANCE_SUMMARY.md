- **Winner**: Kruskal (better for very large sparse graphs)

## 🔍 Algorithm Selection Guidelines

### Choose Prim's Algorithm When:
- ✅ Graph is dense (high edge-to-vertex ratio)
- ✅ Graph size is small to medium (< 1000 vertices)
- ✅ Memory efficiency is important
- ✅ Adjacency list representation is natural

### Choose Kruskal's Algorithm When:
- ✅ Graph is very sparse (low edge-to-vertex ratio)
- ✅ Graph size is very large (> 1000 vertices)
- ✅ Edge list representation is natural
- ✅ Parallel processing is desired

## 📈 Scalability Analysis

| Graph Size | Prim Advantage | Kruskal Advantage |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| < 100 vertices | Strong | Weak |
| 100-500 vertices | Moderate | Moderate |
| 500-1000 vertices | Weak | Moderate |
| > 1000 vertices | Weak | Strong |

## ✅ Conclusion

Both algorithms are **100% correct** and produce identical MST costs. The choice depends on graph characteristics:

- **Prim** excels for dense graphs and moderate sizes
- **Kruskal** scales better for very large sparse graphs
- **Graph density** is the key determining factor

**Overall Recommendation**: Use Prim for most practical applications, Kruskal for very large sparse networks.
